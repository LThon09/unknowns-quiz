This is a source code of my Java game!

There are correct answers that I marked in the game file, if you don't want spoiler don't read the Game.java file!

**Edit**: The game has been deleted permanently, you can still access to the game and play it through the code using Eclipse to export it to a .jar file (Executable)!
